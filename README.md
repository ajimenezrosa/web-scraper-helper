# web-scraper-helper
The Coveo Cloud V2 Web and Sitemap source types can use a web scraping configuration to exclude web page sections, extract metadata, and create sub-items (see [Web Scraping Configuration](http://www.coveo.com/go?dest=cloudhelp&lcid=9&context=277)). 

The web-scraper-helper works directly in your browser allowing you to easily create and test your web scraping configuration when visiting pages requiring web scraping.  

## Description
This project started with a [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) script and was later converted to a Google Chrome extension. 

- Google Chrome extension
  
  It is recommended to use the Chrome extension, as it is simpler to integrate and more up-to-date. 
  
  Continue with the Chrome extension [README](misc/chrome_extension/README.md). 

- Tampermonkey script
  
  Use the Tampermonky script only when you want to customize the script. 
  
  Continue with the Tampermonkey script [README](misc/Tampermonkey/README.md)).
